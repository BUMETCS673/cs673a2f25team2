OVERVIEW

The Health Management System repository contains a comprehensive automated test suite covering:
• Backend Unit Tests: JUnit + Mockito for service layer testing
• Frontend Unit Tests: Vitest + Vue Test Utils for component and utility testing
• Integration Tests: API testing with Postman/Newman

Testing is integrated into the development workflow and can be run locally or as part of CI/CD pipeline.
